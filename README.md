**Don't use this app to ACTUALLY crypt some vulnerable information of yours.**

> It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. 
> For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on.
